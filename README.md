# A LIGHTWEIGHT DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR CALCIFICATION
## 📚 Project Overview


## 🗄️ Dataset
The dataset is available at [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/cbis-ddsm-breast-cancer-image-dataset/data).
In this project, we use cropped images, ``calc_case_description_test_set.csv`` and ``calc_case_description_train_set.csv``. The pre-processing part is in ``01_preprocessing.ipynb``

Order dataset and create some new folders following this structure:

```
/project-folder
    01_preprocessing.ipynb
    02_feature_extraction.ipynb
    03_heat_map.ipynb
    04_process.ipynb
    calc_case_description_test_set.csv
    calc_case_description_train_set.csv
    /features
        /logo
    /raw
        /cropped_images_all
        /image
            all images folders...
    /visualization
```

## ⚙️ Requirements
Please install the following dependencies before running the notebooks:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the notebooks in order:
- `01_preprocessing.ipynb`
- `02_feature_extraction.ipynb`
- `03_heat_map.ipynb`
- `04_process.ipynb`

## 📣 Notes
- Ensure the dataset path inside the notebooks matches your local directory.
- For very large datasets, consider batch processing if memory issues arise.
